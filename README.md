# AnonCom: Better-TCP-Chat 
goofy ahh private (hoepfully) TCP Chat

**How to Use Client?** <br>
Download the client.c, Makefile, setup.sh and runClient.sh files <br>
Get dependencies [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) using `./setup.sh` on any linux terminal (tested on WSL/Termux/VMWare using Ubuntu/Kali) <br>
Compile using `make` <br?
Execute using `./runClient.sh` for 1st time or simply `./client` for subsequent executions <br>
Enter the public host IP `152.67.7.144` <br>
Enter the port `25021` <br>
Enter the password (if in allowlist) else the golden passkey <br>
Beep Boop - You're in!...as long as my server.c is running ;) <br>
